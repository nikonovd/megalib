# megalib visualizer
A visualization library for MegaL models.

## Motivation
[MegaL](https://github.com/softlang/megalib/blob/master/docs/LanguageDescription.pdf) is a text-based modeling language to describe relations between software artifacts and their corresponding concepts. As textual models are rather hard to read, a visualization library is to be considered to create a graphical representation of the model. Megalib visualizer is a component implemented as a part of the megalib providing this functionality.
