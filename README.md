# Project Megalib
This project has three contributions. 
* The first component is a Java program 'checker' that can be used to check the well-formedness of a .megal file.
* The second component is a collection of illustrative megamodels as a set of .megal files in './models/'.
* Further documentation on the MegaL language can be found in './docs' and the project's Wiki.
