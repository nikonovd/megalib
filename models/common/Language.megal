/* A language is a set of syntactic entities. This not only includes
entities having a concrete syntax but runtime data as well.
Language subtypes based on PRIMARY purpose. LaTeX could be used
to code up a general purpose program as well, but hopefully none does
that. That is why it is classified as a markup language. */
